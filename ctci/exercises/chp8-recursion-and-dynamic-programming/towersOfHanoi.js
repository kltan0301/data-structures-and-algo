// In the classic problem of the towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks
// of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending
// order of size from top to bottom (i.e, each disk sits on top of an even largr one). You can have the following
// constraints:

// (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time
// (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower
// (3) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
